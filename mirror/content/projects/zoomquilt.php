<p>I came across this innovative collaborative art project and was intrigued 
with it, but examining the options they had for presentation I found that I 
wished they had a smoother animation to show how well the artwork interlocks.  
I hacked something up in Flash and sent it to the authors.  They liked it and 
put it on their site, and the Flash animation made it to the front of many 
popular sites including <a href="http://metafilter.com/">metafilter</a> and <a 
href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com">ebaumsworld</a> (sometimes incorrectly 
attributed to my name only).  It looks like the project even has a <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoomquilt">wikipedia entry</a> now.</p>

<div id="zoomquilt-flash" style="width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">Flash animation was unable to load.</div>
