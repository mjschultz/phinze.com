title: Why Internet Explorer had better support HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt;
---

At the behest of the [Processing.js folks' request][1], I just wrote this up in
the Microsoft Connect feedback thingy for Internet Explorer.

So I apparently ended up channeling the Oracle of the Web, prophesying DOOM TO
ALL WHO DARE IGNORE THE PORTENTS OF THESE TIMES.  Nevertheless, I stand behind
what I wrote.

[^word]: I wish I had realized before I submitted my comment that
'obstinance'---the word I originally used here---is not, in fact, a word.
Luckily I get to blame it on the fact that I was _forced_ to use IE in order to
actually register for Microsoft Connect, and so I was typing outside of the
supportive embrace of vim or firefox spell check.
